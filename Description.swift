                                                The 'Ultimate' Collection View Boilerplate
 

                                                is a mini-app you can download and run,
 
 built on a single class (*) that covers most ways you'd probably want a collection view to behave.
 
 Just initialize the collection views you need, with the parameters you need, and add a navigation button for each; that's it.
 
 
 
 
 
                                                Goals
 
 
 ❏❏  To save you development time setting up views, especially custom UICollectionViewFlowLayouts (depending on the application, they can be tricky.)
 
 ❏❏  To make collection views look, to the developer(**), more like a simple data structure (like a dictionary)
     rather than the awkward, fragile creatures they often are. (***)
 
 
 
 
 
                        Notes
 
 
 (*) Ok, it's really two: the layout and the collection view controller. But the former is a property of the latter, so it's as if it's one.
 
 (**) In particular, devs who prefer to write most projects purely programmatically, rather than using storyboards.
 
 (***) Try copying & pasting the below Creature right under where he currently is (does it work for you?)

                        Coming Updates
 
  

    [Performance]
  
    faster (& 100% reliable) tabbed navigation between collection views, even on old devices (currently testing this, on project "DMY-Tabs-Calendar")
 
 
 
 
    [UI]
  
    cell cornerRadius & layer border init parameters
 
 
 
 
    [UX - code]
